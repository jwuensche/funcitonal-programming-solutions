# Underscore in other languages

Chosen Example: Rust

- Yes the underscore operator is a valid identifier.
- The underscore is generally used as a notifier to the compiler that this variable is unused and this is known to the programmer, e.g. `fn foo(important: u32, _not_important: i16) {}`
- Also as the `otherwise` in match operations.
